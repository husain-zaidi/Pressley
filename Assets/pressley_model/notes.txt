mat1 and mat2 shapes cannot be multiplied (5x10496 and 512x512)


both image and action embeddings should be same size


resnet gives 2048 size embeddings
so I added a Linear layer to make it 512

what is the relation between context length and batch size


input should be batch X Time X tokensize
fix loss computation
