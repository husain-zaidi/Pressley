## Pressley: A Robot Transformer-like Model to iron clothes [WIP]

Attempting to make a Robot Transformer that is simulated in unity robotics and trained from RTX dataset. 

- Data used for training: https://rail-berkeley.github.io/bridgedata/

- Inspired by https://github.com/google-research/robotics_transformer/tree/master && https://github.com/vimalabs/VIMA/blob/main/vima/policy/vima_policy.py 

Need assistance in fixing the transformer training
